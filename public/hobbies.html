<h1>My biggest passions:</h1>  
  <ul>
<li>My favourite hobby is Cycling - I am a trekking cycler. I love to make a long trips on Bicycle - I rode through german and polish coast until the russian border, Green Velo path, which goes through eastern parts of Poland and many more planned - e.g. from Croatian Pula to Gdansk in Poland, Spanish south coast and many more :)</li>
<li>I am also a big fan of survival - thats a great feeling when you know how to start a fire without nothing in your pocket and it goes handy when my friends can't start a fire :)</li>
<li>And also - programming. In the matter of fact - my dream is to be able to develop a video games and simulators, to create a worlds, histories and make it possible to experience them by others. Obviously I like Video Games :)</li>
